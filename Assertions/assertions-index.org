* Assertions Intro

1. Assertions: Formal or Informal
1. [[./assertions-in-the-small.html][Tiny Examples]] Just tiny^2 examples
2. [[./practical-advice.org][Practical-Advice]] on Assertions
3. Partial Correctness + Termination
   1. Hoare's Axiomatics is only about Partial Correctness, no
      termination
   2. Dijkstra's Weakest Preconditions (Predicate Transformers)
      include termination also
   3. An Unsolved Problem (as of 2017): The [[./3np1.org][3n+1]] Termination Problem

* Entry and Exit Assertions

1. Context: Methods/ Procs/ Functions

** Entry Assertions
1. An Entry Assertion ought to be true before entering a method.
1. This should be guaranteed by the caller.
1. The method assumes this.
1. It does not check it.  If it does, the Entry Assertion of the
   method is simply "true".

** Exit Assertions

1. An Exit Assertion is guaranteed to be true just before exiting a
   method.
1. This is assumed by the caller upon return.  The caller does not
   [have to] check it.  If it does, the exit assertion does not
   change.  Caller is merely wasting CPU cycles.

** Exercises

1. Look up the man pages for a few of the C standard library methods,
   and give entry + exit assertions.  E.g.,
   1. Specify =double sqrt(double x)=  lookup =man 3 sqrt=

1. Specify Bubble Sort.
1. Does the above apply to QuickSort?
1. QuickSort uses a method often named partiton.  Spec it.
1. How do you specify that the array elements going in are the same as
   that come after a sort?

* Loop Invariants

1. An assertion A placed at a point in a loop is an /invariant/ if the
   it remains true at every iteration.

1. We want the strongest loop invariant.
