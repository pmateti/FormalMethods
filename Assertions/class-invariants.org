1. OOP Classes and Abstract Data Types are strongly coupled.  This
   coupling is best exhibited through class invariants.

1. Every class has an assertion that describes the relationships among
   its data members and public methods.  This called the class invariant.

1. See [[../Examples/SmallSet/]] for an example that starts out from
   designing a set class, with the expected public methods such as
   add-an-element, etc.
