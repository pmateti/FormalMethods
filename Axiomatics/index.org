* Orientation

1. We get into a bit of philosophical underpinnings.
1. Necessary in formal proofs of correctness of code.

* What is an Axiom?

1. An axiom is an expression in mathematical logic.
1. We always consider a collection of axioms.
1. Truthful?
1. Any other expectations?

** Expectations

2. A collection of axioms describe worlds of our interest
   1. A world where all the axioms are [held to be] true.
   1. There can be worlds where one or more of the axioms are [held to
      be] false.  (We are not interested in these.)
   1. Must there be a world where all the axioms are true?

4. Axioms in a collection ought to be independent.  [No axiom is
   deducible from others.]
3. The collection is expected to be not contradictory. [sound]
3. The collection may not be "complete". [truth]

** Dedekind-Peano Axioms [ 1889] for Numbers

1. The 0 is a natural number.
1. For every natural number n, S(n) is a natural number. [S is a function.]
1. For all natural numbers m and n, m = n iff if S(m) = S(n).
1. For every natural number n, S(n) = 0 is false.

** Equality Relation

1. The following are valid in First-Order Logic with Equality.

1. For every natural number x, x = x. [reflexive]
1. For all natural numbers x and y, if x = y, then y = x. [symmetric]
1. For all natural numbers x, y and z, if x = y and y = z, then x = z. [transitive]
1. For all a and b, if b is a natural number and a = b, then a is also
   a natural number. [Natural numbers are closed under equality.]

* Semantics of Assignment by an Axiom

1. Consider /x := e/, where x is a variable, and e an expression.

1. Assume that x is a whole variable, not, e.g., part of an array as in a[i].

1. Assume that the value e computes is well-defined and of the same
   type as x.

** {Q(e)} x := e {Q(x)}

** Floyd-Hoare Triples {P} S {Q}

1. S is code in some PL; P and Q are assertions.
1. Th entire triplet yields true/false.
1. {P} S {Q} is "operationally defined" as: For all states s that
   satisfy P, executing S on s, the resulting state s' is such that s'
   satisfies Q, if and when S terminates.

2. Note that the above is about /partial correctness/: It omits
   termination.

* Axiomatic Semantics

* Axioms of an Ideal + Simple PL

* Example: exchange x with y

1. Consider
   #+begin_src C
void exchange( int * x, int * y)
{
  int tmp = * x;
  * x = * y;
  * y = tmp;
}
#+end_src

1. Is this "correct"? [wrt "what spec"? YKWIM]

* Axiomatic Subset of C

1. Nothing to do with "axiomatic C compiler", by a company with that
   name.
