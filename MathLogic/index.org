Landing page for Discrete Math + Logic

* Overview

1. Assertions: Formal or Informal
1. Informally stated assertions: Carefully written, but in English.
1. Formally stated assertions: Discrete Math + Mathematical Logic 
1. Our treatment is in support of Automated Proofs of Assertions

* Discrete Math

1. Sets, Sequences, Bags, Tables
1. Trees: n-ary, (spatially) ordered trees, traversals, subtrees, forests
1. Undirected and directed graphs, connected components

* Mathematical Logic

1. Propositional calculus
1. Predicate calculus
1. Higher Order Logic

** Weaker/Stronger Predicates

1. Simple example: x > 7 implies x > 1.
1. Consider: P implies Q (also written as P ⇒ Q). We say that P is
   /stronger/ than Q. Alt: Q is /weaker/ than P.

** A Model for a WFF

1. Well-formed-formulae P and Q, in general, have free variables, x,
   y, z, ... Consider a particular assignment A of values for each of
   x, y, z that makes P come out True. A will also make Q True.

1. In the context of programming, we can refer to this A as a "state".
   In logic, this is known as a model.

1. Let C(Q) be the collection of such assignments that make Q come out
   as True.  Similarly, C(P).

1. Then, C(P) is a subset of C(Q), if and when P is stronger than Q.

1. If C(P) = C(Q), P is equivalent to Q (also written as P ⇔ Q, or P ≡
   Q).
